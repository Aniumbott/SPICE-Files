## About
- This a collection of NETLIST code files for different electronics logic circuits that I've designed as a part of my lab assignments in the course of my undergraduate studies.
- I've used NGSPICE as the simulator for these circuits. (For more information, you can check out my blog [here.](https://aniketrana.tech/posts/blogs/ngspice/))
